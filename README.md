# Terraform-Vagrant-Ansible
The project assumption was to get to know better tools such as Ansible, Vagrant, Grafana and Prometheus. I was trying to imitate the professional work environment. While creating this project the most important for me were automating work as it is possible and constant monitoring of my resources. <br><br>

Tools which I have used:<br>
Vagrant and Virtual Box - I have installed the VB then I have created six virtual machines using Vagrant. My Vagrantfile contains information about:<br>
The name of the VM.<br>
VM image (Ubuntu).<br>
The network card configuration. I have to set the appropriate IP address, network mode and turn on the second adapter in "Host-only Adapter" mode.
